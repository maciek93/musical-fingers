musical-fingers
===============

Music app using Leap Motion Controllers. Implements several different instruments.

To run this app, we use a depricated version of the JAVA run time environment,  JRE 1.6 . To run the app, you will need to install  JDK/JRE 1.6.  Once this has been done,change settings in eclipse in ' run configurations' -> 'Execution Environment' so that the right JDK/JRE is used.
